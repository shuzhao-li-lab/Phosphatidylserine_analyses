# How to run?
- change the configurations based on `docker-compose.yaml`
- Then run `docker compose run asari`
- *Asari* requires at least 4 cores and easily well over > 2G memory. Before running it, make sure that you have that resource in docker preference file. Also see closed github issue in Asari.
