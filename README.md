# Reanalysis of Rafi's data with asari

## mode 
- HILICpos

## normalization
- Using both TIC & cell number normalization strategy
- find out the cell number normalization cannot work out. See #8
- Thus rename this branch and create TIC normalization branch 

## Next
- Will continue on analysis with TIC normalzation that will become branch `asari-HILICpos-TICnorm`
- The output will stay in the same folders as it is not that different for `TICnorm` branch as they will be similar.
- But some output from this branch will move to `/history`
