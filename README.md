# PS-targeted Lipidomics analyses of Exhausted CD8 T cells
- Supporting materials for Christopher B. Medina et al.'s paper - "Exposed phosphatidylserine as a non-classical inhibitory molecule during CD8 T cell exhaustion"

## Lipidomics
- The analyses was initiated by March 13rd, 2023
- We found increased PS species in exhausted CD8 T cells, consistent with RNA-seq analyses.
